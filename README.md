# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Enter a valid zip-code in America and get the weather data from that city. Enter how you feel and the data will be saved as well.

## Limitations
You can only enter zip-codes from The United States. You have to enter 5 digits otherwise an alert will be shown.

## Weather Data Source
Data is pulled from "openweathermap.org" and shown in metric units. Sorry for all you imperial guys out there. Learn the metric system... you'll thank me later :)
